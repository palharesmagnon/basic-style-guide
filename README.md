<!-- ## Fork this repo to play a little -->

<!-- If you haven't had any experience with the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) preprocessor for CSS yet, I suggest -->
<!-- following the steps below to run the project on your machine. And remember, only modify -->
<!-- the [.SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss) files. -->

<!-- ### NodeJS -->

<!-- Check the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) documentation and install it on your machine. -->
<!-- After installation, check if -->
<!-- the [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#checking-your-version-of-npm-and-nodejs) -->
<!-- package is installed by running the command: -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- npm -v -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Now install the project's dev dependencies: -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- npm install -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Running Sass to watch the .scss files -->

<!-- In the project's root folder, run the command: -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- npx sass --watch styles/sass/style.scss:styles/css/main.css -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Using [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/) to monitor real-time changes -->

<!-- In a new tab of your command terminal, execute the following command: -->

<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- npx browser-sync start --server --files "**/*" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This command will monitor for changes in all files in the project's root folder. -->
